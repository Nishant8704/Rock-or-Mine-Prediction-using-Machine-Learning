# Classifying-the-unknown-Rock-or-Mine-using-Sonar-and-Machine-Learning.
A machine learning model that predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine using sonar signal data. Built using Python and Scikit-learn, the project includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation of various classifiers on the UCI Sonar dataset to achieve accurate binary classification.
